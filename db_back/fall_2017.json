This is a communication-intensive course.Prerequisites/Corequisites: Prerequisite: PDI I or PDI II or permission of instructor.When Offered: Fall term annually.Credit Hours: 4","department_id":20,"sections":[{"id":1242,"name":"01","crn":46316,"seats":35,"seats_taken":32,"instructors":["Nieusma"],"num_periods":2,"course_id":536,"conflicts":[31,32,63,66,67,68,69,141,171,212,229,246,247,248,249,263,270,271,284,331,341,350,403,405,424,428,438,455,458,491,495,501,505,509,544,561,573,614,629,630,652,654,660,663,664,667,674,718,719,720,721,722,723,724,725,726,727,740,746,747,749,763,780,782,785,899,906,907,910,913,916,924,936,939,946,1049,1050,1059,1063,1069,1070,1074,1090,1095,1102,1107,1114,1124,1131,1146,1175,1177,1178,1184,1222,1223,1244,1262,1275,1282,1313,1320,1336,1362,1381,1388,1398,1401,1403,1426,1625,1626,1627,1628,1629,1630,1631,1632,1670,1671,1672,1673,1678,1679,1680,1681,1687,1688,1703,1740,1753,1776,1777,1781,1785,1789,1798,1806,1807,1812,1820,1832,1857,1869,1876,1921,1934,1938,1957,1966,1972,1975,2037,2052,2053,2054,2060,2065,2066,2067,2080,2081,2091,2092,2126,2127,2128,2151,2153,2154,2163,2166,2169,2172,2174,2177,2209,2213,2222,2229,2231,2237,2243,2270,2271],"periods":[{"type":"LAB","day":2,"start":1400,"end":1650},{"type":"LAB","day":5,"start":1400,"end":1650}],"course_name":"Product Design and Innovation Studio III","course_number":2610,"department_code":"IHSS"}]},{"id":950,"name":"Generative Stem","number":4964,"min_credits":4,"max_credits":4,"description":"","department_id":20,"sections":[{"id":2207,"name":"01","crn":49133,"seats":0,"seats_taken":9,"instructors":["Lachney"],"num_periods":2,"course_id":950,"conflicts":[9,64,70,80,91,99,125,126,127,149,170,218,227,243,244,264,273,274,281,286,330,331,332,333,339,346,348,355,400,401,402,405,406,407,410,413,414,415,427,436,440,441,442,456,496,503,552,575,611,625,661,662,670,678,693,694,712,748,764,769,781,794,873,880,901,903,904,905,908,917,932,938,947,1047,1062,1068,1091,1092,1105,1113,1117,1140,1150,1181,1182,1232,1235,1241,1268,1270,1276,1284,1325,1334,1337,1348,1350,1357,1361,1367,1375,1376,1377,1378,1379,1391,1394,1399,1429,1434,1577,1578,1579,1580,1581,1582,1583,1584,1593,1594,1595,1596,1597,1598,1599,1600,1613,1614,1615,1616,1621,1622,1623,1624,1642,1643,1644,1645,1666,1667,1668,1669,1695,1741,1746,1750,1754,1764,1770,1772,1800,1804,1809,1818,1859,1864,1918,1932,1936,1949,1950,1969,1981,2029,2032,2068,2069,2096,2098,2101,2133,2167,2173,2178,2183,2197,2204,2214,2216,2240,2241],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":2,"start":1000,"end":1150},{"type":"LEC","day":5,"start":1000,"end":1150}],"course_name":"Generative Stem","course_number":4964,"department_code":"IHSS"}]},{"id":537,"name":"Research Methods","number":6960,"min_credits":3,"max_credits":3,"description":"This course provides a forum for interdisciplinary graduate discourse and community at Rensselaer.

While the end results will be representational including diagrams, renderings, and graphic instructions for construction, explorations will target how digital tools can become procedurally integral with design and how they can open up greater opportunity for creative design study. Digital techniques will be investigated as developmental tools rather than an assistant representational technology. Parametric modeling will also be utilized to help manage and clarify complex relationships between systems and environments. We will be working with a master model / Building Information Modeling (BIM) logic, in which a single application software will be the predominant digital resource, and workflow becomes essential to the successful development of the project. The computer, like any other design tool, has its place. There are more and less appropriate applications for any method, and the various computational techniques will be used together with analog modes of working.

Rather than human-machine interaction, cognitive computing is said to be leading to a new generation of human-machine collaboration, where computers help humans gain new insights into problems via a suite of technologies ranging from natural language to machine learning. The \"coming of age\" of cognitive computing was demonstrated when IBM's Watson program beat the world's experts at the TV gameshow Jeopardy! The 2015 announcement of the Cognitive and Immersive Systems Lab (CISL), a collaboration between the IBM Research and RPI, explores new research in human-scale situations rooms for human-machine partnership. In this course, we will explore several types of cognitive computing architectures, including Watson, neuromorphic computing, and agent-based modeling, and try to discover, via team projects motivated by the students in the class, what, if anything, is truly new and exciting in this technology space. Students should be willing to work in small teams on research-related projects requiring the teams to define, plan and implement their approaches.

Rather than human-machine interaction, cognitive computing is said to be leading to a new generation of human-machine collaboration, where computers help humans gain new insights into problems via a suite of technologies ranging from natural language to machine learning. The \"coming of age\" of cognitive computing was demonstrated when IBM's Watson program beat the world's experts at the TV gameshow Jeopardy! The 2015 announcement of the Cognitive and Immersive Systems Lab (CISL), a collaboration between the IBM Research and RPI, explores new research in human-scale situations rooms for human-machine partnership. In this course, we will explore several types of cognitive computing architectures, including Watson, neuromorphic computing, and agent-based modeling, and try to discover, via team projects motivated by the students in the class, what, if anything, is truly new and exciting in this technology space. Students should be willing to work in small teams on research-related projects requiring the teams to define, plan and implement their approaches.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the studentâs access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

The interdependence among building materials, acoustic qualities, enclosure systems, interior, finish, and other systems is investigated, with an emphasis on the broader architectural design endeavor. Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups.

Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed.Prerequisites/Corequisites: Prerequisite: ARCH 2510 except M.Arch. students.When Offered: Fall term annually.Credit Hours: 2","department_id":36,"sections":[{"id":10,"name":"01","crn":46091,"seats":90,"seats_taken":64,"instructors":["Comodromos"],"num_periods":1,"course_id":9,"conflicts":[30,84,172,187,211,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,266,332,352,415,416,418,419,420,421,422,426,461,492,493,549,554,557,633,697,698,699,720,721,729,734,736,738,753,762,791,877,890,895,896,904,915,925,945,1054,1064,1076,1079,1080,1081,1082,1133,1142,1143,1151,1171,1174,1233,1245,1246,1247,1248,1258,1352,1359,1360,1361,1362,1363,1364,1365,1366,1367,1371,1375,1384,1386,1413,1423,1562,1564,1566,1568,1570,1572,1574,1576,1593,1595,1597,1599,1601,1602,1603,1604,1605,1606,1607,1608,1650,1651,1652,1653,1828,1860,1872,1955,1958,1971,2059,2078,2090],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":3,"start":1200,"end":1350}],"course_name":"Construction Systems","course_number":2350,"department_code":"ARCH"}]},{"id":10,"name":"Materials and Design","number":2510,"min_credits":2,"max_credits":2,"description":"This course establishes an understanding of the most common materials, their properties and resulting uses, and the implications of their uses in the larger context of material life cycles. The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle.When Offered: Fall and summer annually.Credit Hours: 2","department_id":36,"sections":[{"id":11,"name":"01","crn":47762,"seats":90,"seats_taken":75,"instructors":["Comodromos"],"num_periods":1,"course_id":10,"conflicts":[37,65,84,85,98,114,250,251,252,253,258,330,415,425,430,437,438,439,440,441,442,488,506,547,551,633,696,703,711,718,719,728,735,737,795,891,893,903,940,1053,1064,1075,1128,1132,1170,1174,1271,1279,1288,1316,1324,1363,1371,1379,1386,1412,1436,1569,1571,1573,1575,1577,1579,1581,1583,1585,1587,1589,1591,1593,1594,1595,1596,1597,1598,1599,1600,1621,1622,1623,1624,1646,1647,1648,1649,1666,1667,1668,1669,1687,1688,1700,1701,1709,1827,1860,1872,1940,1942,1953,1954,2031,2192,2210,2273,2274],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":3,"start":1000,"end":1150}],"course_name":"Materials and Design","course_number":2510,"department_code":"ARCH"}]},{"id":11,"name":"Digital Constructs 1","number":2520,"min_credits":2,"max_credits":2,"description":"This course will examine and teach methods of representation and the communication of design concepts.Â Skills taught will enable students to produce two-dimensional and three-dimensional digital models, as well as drawings from multiple perspectives.Â Students will understand virtual environments as they pertain to model making, drawing, scale, and materiality.Â  Students will be introduced to digital modeling and graphic design softwares.

the relationship between building and landscape in terms of conceptual, pragmatic, ideological, aesthetic, and functional issues. As such, it endeavors to examine critically the disciplinary boundary between building and landscape. It also critically assesses the connections and inherent complexities between an institutional situation, workplace activity, and residential inhabitation in order to explore questions of publicness and privacy. This studio also addresses the tectonic dimensions of construction and structure in architectural design.

focuses on the integration of structural, technical, detail, zoning, and code-related issues with respect to the design of a moderate to large-scale building of civic importance. Such building types are (but not limited to) libraries, theaters, city halls, judicial buildings, educational buildings, etc. An important focus of the design project will be the relationship of the building to its urban context. An essential part of the design will involve programming of the building as well as responding to numerous of the learning outcomes defined by the NAAB (the accrediting agency for professional architecture programs) for a comprehensive design project.Â  \n\nThis course is required of all architecture undergraduates in the B.Arch. program.Prerequisites/Corequisites: ARCH 4830 Integrated

Students will conduct research into industrial design processes, found especially in the automotive, aviation and maritime industries, and will adapt these processes into techniques to design a prototype for limited production. Instruction will include: the full scale production of a prototype, its detailing; Color/Material/Finishes (CMF), design for Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), and the possibility of mass customization.","department_id":36,"sections":[{"id":70,"name":"01","crn":48919,"seats":12,"seats_taken":7,"instructors":["Russo"],"num_periods":1,"course_id":34,"conflicts":[9,80,125,126,127,149,170,218,227,243,244,264,273,274,281,286,330,331,332,333,339,346,348,355,400,405,406,407,410,413,414,415,427,436,440,441,442,456,496,503,575,611,625,661,662,670,678,748,764,768,769,781,794,796,873,880,901,903,904,905,908,917,932,938,947,1047,1068,1091,1092,1105,1113,1117,1150,1181,1182,1232,1235,1241,1268,1270,1276,1284,1334,1337,1348,1350,1357,1367,1375,1376,1377,1378,1379,1391,1394,1399,1429,1434,1577,1578,1579,1580,1581,1582,1583,1584,1595,1596,1599,1600,1614,1616,1622,1624,1642,1643,1644,1645,1666,1667,1668,1669,1695,1741,1746,1750,1754,1764,1770,1772,1800,1809,1859,1864,1918,1932,1936,1949,1950,1969,1981,2029,2032,2068,2069,2096,2133,2167,2173,2178,2183,2197,2204,2207,2214,2216,2240,2241],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":5,"start":1000,"end":1150}],"course_name":"Contemporary Furniture Design","course_number":4958,"department_code":"ARCH"}]},{"id":35,"name":"The Man Next Door: Hitchcock","number":4961,"min_credits":2,"max_credits":2,"description":"","department_id":36,"sections":[{"id":71,"name":"01","crn":48494,"seats":12,"seats_taken":14,"instructors":["Oatman"],"num_periods":1,"course_id":35,"conflicts":[128,129,543,556,692,693,694,695,696,697,698,699,700,701,702,703,704,705,706,707,708,709,710,711,712,713,718,719,720,721,722,723,724,725,726,727,741,751,752,891,892,896,897,898,929,1072,1309,1792,1811,1813,1824,1825,2035,2115,2156,2237,2238],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":1,"start":1900,"end":2150}],"course_name":"The Man Next Door: Hitchcock","course_number":4961,"department_code":"ARCH"}]},{"id":36,"name":"Sculpting the Intangible","number":4962,"min_credits":2,"max_credits":2,"description":"Architecture mediates our body with the environment. It describes the way we understand our position in the world and how we perform within it. Light, intrinsically attached to the spatial experience, is able to affect, transform and stimulate not only our visual, but our mental and even bodily perception of things. As designers, we must understand the specifics of a given ambiance, its affects and mechanisms to cultivate a formal precision necessary to reproduce concrete experiences that we might be looking for. How can we use light, an intangible matter, as building material? How color, form and texture affect the ways light is diffused, reflected or aggregated? In other words, how they condition its different manifestations? What are the effects and the effects of the absence of light, shadow or twilight? This seminar intends to refine our ways of seeing and test these new observations through making. It is not about the use and interpretation of light through architectural history. It is about the study of light as a device that transforms or even generates space. It engages with the phenomenological and will compare different artifacts, buildings, and expressions that give an answer to similar questions with independence of the time and location they were created. We will study these different forms of light and their implicit meanings; their capacity to create different illusions, rhythms and relations.","department_id":36,"sections":[{"id":72,"name":"01","crn":48917,"seats":12,"seats_taken":12,"instructors":["Passeri"],"num_periods":1,"course_id":36,"conflicts":[7,79,96,100,101,185,213,214,217,219,228,245,259,272,334,335,340,400,408,419,441,443,448,462,499,508,562,651,657,658,659,671,679,728,729,730,743,744,756,771,775,776,777,866,869,874,876,879,883,911,918,930,937,943,1042,1066,1080,1084,1085,1096,1099,1101,1108,1111,1115,1143,1147,1167,1168,1169,1176,1230,1246,1260,1263,1266,1281,1285,1308,1329,1330,1331,1332,1338,1349,1365,1368,1385,1389,1396,1407,1419,1422,1432,1433,1440,1443,1593,1594,1595,1596,1597,1598,1599,1600,1621,1622,1623,1624,1646,1647,1648,1649,1670,1671,1672,1673,1691,1697,1706,1743,1760,1761,1766,1768,1771,1780,1787,1799,1805,1817,1862,1868,1870,1875,1917,1928,1930,1943,1944,1962,2025,2027,2030,2042,2057,2077,2085,2094,2137,2148,2149,2150,2158,2187,2188,2189,2190,2191,2192,2193,2194,2263],"periods":[{"type":"LEC","day":4,"start":1000,"end":1150}],"course_name":"Sculpting

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations.
