# Sturcure/Wireframe direction:
## Environment for data analysis
This milestone focuses on setting up a nice environment for the data analysis. And ideally, this should be added into Orchestra.
	- Integrate with Orchestra
	- Python3.6
	- MongoDB

## Map out the data we have currently
This is more of a research direction. We need to figure out what kind of data we have now and what we can expect first. After that, we should come up with a freamework that can perfectly divide datas into different part. One possible solution could be divide them by how they are generated: statically or dynamically.
	- Statics Data 
	- Dynamic Data

## Course Selection Alert system
This is a feature that will automatically send mails to school advisors when a course is about to filled up.
	- Try to create a real-time banner grabber.
	- Implement a derivative function for calculting the speed when a course is under registeration.


## Research about recommendation algorithms from existing products.
This is more of a research direction. We want to do course recommend for students by applying some baic discrete mathmatic concepts such as bayes theorem.

- Amazon Recommend Algo
- Implement bayes theorem
- (Ideally) Students classificaiton
